# Consumer Sales Database Design and Analysis

## Objective

For this project we were asked to create a database and migrate data from a .CSV file. Finally, we then use SQL to dissect and analyze our consumer sales trends.

## Part 1: Database Design

1. Create table with appropriate data types named customer_spending
2. Reuse column titles from csv
3. accomodate the full range of values and avoid truncation.
4. verify the data present matches the csv file

## Part 2: Analysis

1. Write a query that returns each category and the corresponding total revenue for that
category for the sale_year 2016. The output should be arranged alphabetically.
2. Write a query that returns a list of sub_categories and their corresponding average
unit_price, average unit_cost, as well as the difference between these two values
(name this column margin) for the sale_year 2015. Organize the results alphabetically.
3. Write a query that returns the total number of female buyers (gender) who made
purchases in the Clothing category.
4. Write a query that returns the age, sub_cateogry, average quantity, and average cost
of products purchased by each age and sub_category. Output should show the
columns in the same order they are listed. Organize the data by age, oldest to youngest,
and then by sub_category alphabetically.
5. Write a query that returns a list of countries where more than 30 transactions were
made by customers between the ages of 18-25 (inclusive).
6. Write a query that returns a list of sub_categories along with their average quantity
and average cost, both rounded to 2 decimal places, and named as avg_quantity and
avg_cost respectively. Only include sub_categories that have at least 10 records in the
data set. Organize the data by sub_category alphabetically.
7. Write a query that returns each sub_cateogry and their respective total quantity and
total revenue for male buyers (gender), in the sale_year of 2016.
8. Write a query to determine each countryâ€™s total revenue generated from sales, sorted
alphabetically.
9. Write a query to determine the highest unit_cost, lowest unit_cost, and average
unit_cost for each gender in each category. The output columns should be gender,
category, high_cost, low_cost, avg_cost. Organize the results by gender and then
category.
10. Write a query to return the country that has the highest average revenue. Your output
columns should be country and high_sales.
